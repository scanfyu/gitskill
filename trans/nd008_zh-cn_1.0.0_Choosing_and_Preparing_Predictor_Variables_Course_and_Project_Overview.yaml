          # Overview

          In the previous course, you learned from Maureen on how to think about your data, clean up the data and deal with outliers. In this next session, we're going to introduce you to Ben from Alteryx who you will see more of in the course **Classification Models**. Ben was nice enough to jump in for Maureen and help you explore how to:

          1. Choose appropriate predictor variables for your regression model.
          2. Look at correlations between predictor variables and choose the best predictor variables for your model.
          3. Deal with *Null* values and go into depth on how to prepare to model categorical variables.

          This lesson will help you deal with the many variables you'll need to consider in Project 2.2.
